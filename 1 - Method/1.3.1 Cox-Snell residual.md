# Cox-Snell residual
## Concept
* *What is it:* estimated cumulative hazard at time $t_{i}$ which is the observed time for the $i$-th individual. It transforms the observed survival times so that under a correctly specified model, the residuals should follow an exponential distribution with mean 1.
* *When to use it:* assess the goodness of fit of a model
* *How to use it:* 
    1. Plot the Cox-Snell residuals against the theoretical exponential distribution (e.g., using a QQ plot).
    2. Plot the Cox-Snell residuals' cumulative hazard (using a Nelson-Aalen estimator) to see if it follows a 45-degree line.

## Definition
The Cox-Snell residual for subject $i$ with response time $t_{i}$
$$\begin{align*} \hat{r}_{i} &= - \log{[\hat{S}(t_{i})]} \\ &= \hat{H}(t_{i}) \\ &= \hat{H}_{0}(t_{i}) \exp{(X_{i}^{T} \hat{\beta})} \end{align*}$$
- $i \in \{1,2,...,n\}$: subjects
- $t_{i}$: the observed survival or censoring time for the $i$-th individual. They are distinct and ordered *i.e.* $t_{1} < t_{2} <...< t_{D}$, where $D$ is the total number of events
- $\hat{S}(t_{i})$: the estimated survival function
- $\hat{H}(t_{i})$: the estimated cumulative hazard function
- $\hat{H}_{0}(t)$ is the Breslow's estimator of the baseline cumulative hazard rate $$\hat{H}_{0}(t) = \sum\limits_{t_{i} \leq t} \frac{d_{i}}{\sum\limits_{j \in R(t_{i})}\exp{(X_{j}^{T}\hat{\beta})}}$$
	- $d_{i}$: the number of events at time $t_{i}$
	- $R(t_{i})$: the risk set at time $t_i$ which is the set of all sample units who have yet to fail prior to time $t_i$
- $X_{i}$: the covariate vector for subject $i$
- $\hat{\beta}$: the estimated vector of regression coefficients
