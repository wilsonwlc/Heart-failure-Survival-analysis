# Deviance residual
## Concept
- *What is it:*: the transformation of the Martingale residuals
- *When to use it:* Identify outliers
- *How to use it:* Plot the deviance residuals against observation ID. Deviance residuals should be roughly symmetric around zero with an approximate standard deviation of 1

## Definition
$$\hat{d}_{i} = \mathrm{sign}(\hat{m}_{i}) \sqrt{-2[\hat{m}_{i}+\delta_{i}\log(\delta_{i}-\hat{m}_{i})]}$$
- $\hat{m}_{i}$: Martingale residual for subject $i$
- $\delta_{i}$: is the event indicator (1 if the event was observed, 0 if censored)

## Interpretation
- Positive values indicate that the individual died sooner than expected by the model
- Negative values indicate that the individual lived longer than expected (or was censored)
- Very large positive or negative values suggest potential outliers or influential observations
