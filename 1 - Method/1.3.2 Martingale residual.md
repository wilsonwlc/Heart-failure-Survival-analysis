# Martingale residual
## Concept
* *What is it:* the difference between the observed event indicator and the model's expected cumulative hazard
* *When to use it:* evaluate the functional form of covariates after fitting a Cox regression model
* *How to use it:* plot Martingale residuals against a covariate to check for non-linearity

## Definition
The Martingale residual for subject $i$ is defined as
$$\begin{align*} \hat{m}_{i} &= \delta_{i} - r_{i} \\ &= \delta_{i} - \hat{H}_{i}(t) \\ &= \delta_{i} - \hat{H}_{0}(t_{i}) \exp{(X_{i}^{T} \hat{\beta})} \end{align*}$$
- $i \in \{1,2,...,n\}$: subjects
- $\delta_{i}$: is the event indicator (1 if the event was observed, 0 if censored)
- $r_{i}$: Cox-Snell residual. It depends on the tie handling method
- $t_{i}$: the observed survival or censoring time for the $i$-th individual. They are distinct and ordered *i.e.* $t_{1} < t_{2} <...< t_{D}$, where $D$ is the total number of events
- $\hat{H}_{i}(t)$: the estimated cumulative hazard for individual $i$ up to time $t$
- $\hat{H}_{0}(t)$: the baseline cumulative hazard rate 
- $X_{i}$: the covariate vector for subject $i$
- $\hat{\beta}$: the estimated vector of regression coefficients
