# Schoenfeld residual
## Concept
- *What is it:* a diagnostic tool
- *When to use it:* check the proportional hazards assumption

## Definition
For subject $i \in \{1,2,...,n\}$ with event time $t$, the Schoenfeld residual vector is 
$$\begin{align*} U_{i}(t) &= X_{i}-\bar{X}(t) \\ &= X_{i} - \frac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} Y_{k}(t) X_{k} \exp{(X^{T}_{k} \hat{\beta})}}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} Y_{k}(t) \exp{(X_{k}^{T} \hat{\beta})} } \end{align*}$$
- $U_{i}$: $p$-component vector
- $X_{i}$: covariate of subject $i$
- $\bar{X}(t)$: the weighted average of the covariates over the risk set at time $t$
- $Y_{i}(t)$: an indicator variable that has the value 1 if subject $i$ is at risk at time $t$ and 0 otherwise
- $\beta$: a vector of $p$ parameters
- $\hat{\beta}$: MLE of $\beta$

The scaled schoenfeld residual is defined as
$$U^{*}_{i} = K \mathrm{Cov}(\hat{\beta})U_{i}$$
- $K$: the observed number of uncensored survival times
- $U_{i}$: the Schoenfeld residual
