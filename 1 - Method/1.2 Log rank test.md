# Log-rank test
## Hypothesis
- The null hypothesis is whether the 2 underlying survivor functions are all the same $$H_{0}: S_{1}(t) = S_{2}(t) \hspace{5mm} \text{for all } t \geq 0$$
- The alternative hypothesis is $$H_{1}: S_{1}(t) \text{ is different from } S_{2}(t) \text{ for some } t \geq 0$$
## Notation
- There are $k$ distinct uncensored survival times in the pooled sample $$t_{(1)}<t_{(2)} < \cdots < t_{(k)}$$
- $d_{ij}$: number of deaths in Group $i$ at $t_{(j)}$
- $n_{ij}$: number of individuals in Group $i$ being at risk just before $t_{(j)}$
- $d_{j}$: the number of deaths at time $t_{(j)}$ for the pooled sample
- $n_{j}$: the number of deaths the number of individuals at risk before time $t_{(j)}$ for the pooled sample
## Testing
- Define $$Z_{1} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{k} \left( d_{1j} - \frac{n_{1j}d_{j}}{n_{j}} \right)$$
- The variance is estimated by $$\mathrm{Var}(Z_{1})=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\frac{n_{1j}n_{2j}d_{j}(n_{j}-d_{j})}{n_{j}^{2}(n_{j}-1)}$$
- Under $H_{0}$, $$Q= \frac{Z_{1}^{2}}{\mathrm{Var}(Z_{1})} \sim \chi_{1}^{2}$$
- Reject $H_{0}$ if the observed value of $Q$ is greater than $\chi_{\alpha, df=1}^{2}$
