# Schoenfeld residuals test
## Concept
- Aka **Grambsch and Therneau test**
- *When to do it:* Test whether the covariates meet the proportional hazards assumption

## Test
### Global test for all predictors
#### Hypothesis
- $H_{0}$: The slopes for all of the terms in the model are zero for the relationship between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals and a time-scaled transformation of the event times  
- $H_{1}$: At least one slope is non-zero
#### Test statistics
$$T_{g}=\frac{d R \mathrm{Cov}(\hat{\beta})R^{T}}{(d-1)V_{g}}$$
- $t_{1}, ..., t_{d}$: the event times
- $d$: the number of event times
- $g_{k}$: A time scale transformation of the event times
- $G$: a $d$-dimensional vector whose components are the centred values of $g_{k}$ where $k = 1, ..., d$
- $S$: the $d \times p$ matrix of the Schoenfeld residuals
- $R$: $G^{T}S$
- $\mathrm{Cov}(\hat{\beta})$: the variance-covariance matrix of $\hat{\beta}$
- $V_{g}$: the sample variance of the components of $G$
#### Testing
- Under the null hypothesis that the assumption of proportional hazards is true for all predictors, $T_g$ asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution with $p$ degrees of freedom
### Test for individual predictors
#### Hypothesis
- $H_{0}$: the slope is zero for the relationship between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for a term and a time-scaled transformation of the event times
- $H_{1}$: the slope is non-zero
#### Test statistics
The test statistic with respect to an individual predictor is $$\begin{align*} T_{j} &= \frac{\left[\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d} (g_{k} - \bar{g}) S^{*}_{jk}\right]^{2}}{d \hspace{2mm} [\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta_{j}})]^{2} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{d} (g_{k} - \bar{g})^{2} } \\ &= \frac{\rho^{2} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{d} (S^{*}_{jk})^{2}}{d \hspace{2mm} [\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta_{j}})]^{2}} \end{align*}$$
- $k \in \{1,2,...,d\}$: index of event times
- $g_{k}$: A time scale transformation of the event times
- $\bar{g}$: the sample mean of the components of $G$
- $S^{*}$: the $d \times p$ matrix of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals
- $d$: the number of event times
- $\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_{j})$: the standard error of the $j$-th component of the vector $\hat{\beta}$ of estimated parameters from the Cox proportional hazard model
- $\rho$: the correlation coefficient between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for the $j$-th predictor and the time-transformed functional values $g_{k}$
#### Testing
- Under the null hypothesis that the assumption of proportional hazards is true for the predictor, $T_{j}$ asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
