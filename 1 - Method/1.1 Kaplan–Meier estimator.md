# Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator
## Concept
* Aka **product-limit estimator**
* _What is it_: a non-parametric estimator
* _What it does_: calculate the probability of survival (or remaining event-free) at specific time points, accounting for censored data. As a result, a step-function estimate of the survival function based on observed event times and censoring will be produced
* _How to visualise result_: Kaplan-Meier survival curve

## Estimation
- Let $k$ be the number of distinct uncensored survival times in the sample 
- Assume $t_{(1)}<t_{(2)}<\cdots<t_{(k)}$ be those uncensored observations
- Denote the following notation
	- $d_{j}$ as the number of deaths at $t_{(j)}$
	- $m_{j}$ as the number of censored observations in $[t_{(j)}, t_{(j+1)})$
	- $t_{jl}$ as the $l$-th censored observation in $[t_{(j)}, t_{(j+1)})$ for $l = 1,2,..., m_{j}$
- $n_{j} = \sum\limits_{i=j}^{k} (d_{i}+m_{i})$ is the number of individuals at risk (known to be alive) just prior to time $t_{(j)}$
	- $n_{j+1} = n_{j} - d_{j} - m_{j}$
- Assume the data is right, type I and non-informative censored
- The MLE of the survivor function is given by $$\hat{S}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}  1 & \text{for} \; t<t_{(1)} \\ \prod_{i=1}^{j} \left(1-\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}}\right) & \text{for} \; t_{(j)} \leq t < t_{(j+1)} \; \text{where} \; 1 \leq j \leq k-1  \end{array} \right. $$
    - $t_{(k+1)}$ is taken to be $\infty$
	- $\hat{S}({t})$ is undefined for $t > c$ if the largest observation is a censored survival time $c$
